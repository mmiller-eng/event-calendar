# Project

This repository is managed with [swamp](https://github.com/swamp-club/swamp).

## Rules

1. **Search before you build.** When automating AWS, APIs, or any external service: (a) search community extensions with `swamp extension search <query>` — prefer `@swamp/*` official extensions first, (b) search local/installed types with `swamp model type search <query>`, (c) if a community extension exists, install it with `swamp extension pull <package>` instead of building from scratch, (d) extend an existing type if it covers the domain but lacks the method you need, (e) only create a custom extension model in `extensions/models/` as a last resort. Use the `swamp` skill for guidance. The `command/shell` model is ONLY for ad-hoc one-off shell commands, NEVER for wrapping CLI tools or building integrations.
2. **Extend, don't be clever.** When a model covers the domain but lacks the method you need, extend it with `export const extension` — don't bypass it with shell scripts, CLI tools, or multi-step hacks. One method, one purpose. Use `swamp model type describe <type> --json` to check available methods.
3. **Use the data model.** Once data exists in a model (via `lookup`, `start`, `sync`, etc.), reference it with CEL expressions. Don't re-fetch data that's already available.
4. **CEL expressions everywhere.** Wire models together with CEL expressions. Always prefer `data.latest("<name>", "<dataName>").attributes.<field>` over the deprecated `model.<name>.resource.<spec>.<instance>.attributes.<field>` pattern.
5. **Verify before destructive operations.** Always `swamp model get <name> --json` and verify resource IDs before running delete/stop/destroy methods.
6. **Prefer fan-out methods over loops.** When operating on multiple targets, use a single method that handles all targets internally (factory pattern) rather than looping N separate `swamp model method run` calls against the same model. Multiple parallel calls against the same model contend on the per-model lock, causing timeouts. A single fan-out method acquires the lock once and produces all outputs in one execution. Check `swamp model type describe` for methods that accept filters or produce multiple outputs.
7. **Extension npm deps are bundled, not lockfile-tracked.** Swamp's bundler inlines all npm packages (except zod) into extension bundles at bundle time. `deno.lock` and `package.json` do NOT cover extension model dependencies — this is by design. Always pin explicit versions in `npm:` import specifiers (e.g., `npm:lodash-es@4.17.21`).
8. **Reports for reusable data pipelines.** When the task involves building a repeatable pipeline to transform, aggregate, or analyze model output (security reports, cost analysis, compliance checks, summaries), create a report extension. Use the `swamp` skill for guidance.
9. **"Workflow" means a swamp workflow.** In this repository the word "workflow" (and "create/run/execute/validate/debug workflow", "automate", "orchestrate", "automated/nightly job") refers to a swamp workflow — a declarative YAML DAG of model-method steps authored via `swamp workflow create`. Load and follow the `swamp` skill for these requests. Do NOT interpret these as a request to build an agent task list, spin up worktrees, or schedule a cron/remote agent. Only use those orchestration mechanisms when the user explicitly names one (e.g. "task list", "subagent", "worktree", "cron", "remote agent") or explicitly asks you to do the work yourself step by step rather than author a swamp workflow.
10. **Use swamp, don't bypass it.** Always work through swamp commands — don't go around them with raw shell tools. Use `swamp data query` to find data, not `grep`/`find` on `.swamp/` files. Use model methods to interact with resources, not `curl`/`aws`/`gcloud`/`kubectl` when a model type already wraps that API — check with `swamp model type search`. Use `swamp help` for CLI discovery, not guesswork. Composing with swamp output is fine (e.g. piping `--json` through `jq`) — the anti-pattern is bypassing swamp entirely.
11. **Inspect reports after failures.** When a model method or workflow run fails, inspect its generated reports before retrying or changing definitions. Reports run even on failure and capture structured diagnostics — error messages, execution status, arguments, and data output pointers. Use `swamp report get @swamp/method-summary --model <model> --json` for method failures or `swamp report get @swamp/workflow-summary --workflow <workflow> --json` for workflow failures. Run `swamp help report get` to confirm current retrieval syntax.

## Skills

**IMPORTANT:** Always load swamp skills, even when in plan mode. The skills provide
essential context for working with this repository.

- `swamp` - Swamp CLI — models, workflows, data, vaults, extensions, publishing, repos, reports, issues, and troubleshooting
- `swamp-getting-started` - Interactive onboarding for new swamp users

## Getting Started

**IMPORTANT:** At the start of every conversation, run
`swamp model search --json`. If no models are returned (empty result), you MUST
immediately invoke the `swamp-getting-started` skill before doing anything else.
This walks new users through an interactive onboarding tutorial.

If models already exist, start by using the `swamp` skill to work with
swamp models.

## Commands

Use `swamp --help` to see available commands. For a machine-readable JSON
schema of the CLI (commands, options, arguments) intended for agent
consumption, run `swamp help [<command>...]` — e.g. `swamp help` returns
the full tree, and `swamp help model method run` scopes to a subtree.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
